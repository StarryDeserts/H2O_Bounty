# H2O Bounty: Decentralized Bounty Platform on Sui (Enhanced with ElizaBot)
H2O Bounty is a decentralized task ecosystem built on Sui blockchain, where smart contracts meet community engagement. It enables project creators to launch rewarded tasks, while contributors participate in a transparent environment powered by automated workflows.

Key Innovations:
    - ElizaBot - Your Discord Commander: Every task creation, update, or reward payout triggers real-time announcements in Discord. ElizaBot keeps your community aligned with automated notifications and direct action links.

    - Dynamic SUI Rewards: Flexible reward pools with features like milestone payouts and auto-refunds. ElizaBot broadcasts every SUI movement with blockchain explorer proofs.(TODO)

    - End-to-End Visibility: Track task status from start to finish through ElizaBot's Discord updates, each linked to immutable on-chain records.

    - Dev-Centric Toolkit: Access Sui Move contract templates and beginner quests (e.g., "Deploy a Hello World Contract") via ElizaBot commands, earning verifiable on-chain credentials.

For projects seeking efficient crowdsourcing or developers building blockchain-proven portfolios, H2O Bounty – supercharged by ElizaBot's automation – serves as the trustless bridge between Sui opportunities and global talent.
